This is my recreation of the opening of the iconic hit Bethesda Softworks game "Skyrim" in a text-based RPG inspired by the original Oregon Trail games.

to do:
1. player stats
2. player items
3. inventory
4. action screen +enemy action
6. enemy and combat
7. level up and player xp

#idk if gagawa pako item drops, since im only originally planning to create the intro for Skyrim
#character creation is still up in the air, if im gonna add racial bonuses and abilities
